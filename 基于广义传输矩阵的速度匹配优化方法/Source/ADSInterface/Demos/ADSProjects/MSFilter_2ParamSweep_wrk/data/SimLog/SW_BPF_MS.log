Warning detected by hpeesofsim in Substrate model during netlist flattening.
    Simulations referencing substrate `MSub1' will not include metal loss
    because metal thickness is zero.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 2

Error detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
